TimePro

This website is a landing page for an app that helps students manage time efficiently. 
There is an into section, about the app, and an services info card section. Users will have
an input section to be contacted for further updates about the app as well.

I wanted to make this app, but with the current development skills in WEB I have currently,
I decided to make the landing page. Starting out with this page could eventually lead me to actually
build the app in the future. That is one of my goals before I graduate.
